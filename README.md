## Semantic Versioning

ShipIt.js does semantic version control by `shipitjs release [rerease-type]` command.

The version string must be formatted as follows:

    0.0.1 (major.minor.patch)

or

    0.0.1-1 (major.minor.patch-build)

For example, if current version is '0.0.1', the next version as follows:

* Next major version is '1.0.0'
* Next minor version is '0.1.0'
* Next patch version is '0.0.2'
* Next build version is '0.0.1-1'
